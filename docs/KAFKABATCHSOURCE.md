Usage Notes
-----------

Kafka Streaming Source can be used to read events from a kafka topic. It uses kafka consumer [0.8.2 apis](https://kafka.apache.org/082/documentation.html) to read events from a kafka topic. Kafka Batch Source converts incoming kafka events into cdap structured records which then can be used for further transformations. 

The source will read from the earliest available offset or the initial offset that specified in the config for the first run, remember the last offset it read last run and continue from that offset for the next run. 

Plugin Configuration
---------------------

| Configuration | Required | Default | Description |
| :------------ | :------: | :------ | :---------- |
| **Kafka Brokers** | **Y** | N/A | List of Kafka brokers specified in host1:port1,host2:port2 form. |
| **Kafka Topic** | **Y** | N/A | The Kafka topic to read from. |
| **Offset Table Name** | **Y** | __kafka_batch_source_offsets | Optional table name to track the latest offsets read from Kafka. Stores offsets using a composite key of reference name, topic name and partition. Only change this table name if you would like to ignore the offsets read from a Kafka topic by a previous run using the Kafka Batch Source. | 
| **Topic Partition** | **N** | N/A | List of topic partitions to read from. If not specified, all partitions will be read.  |
| **Initial Partition Offsets** | **N** | N/A | The initial offset for each topic partition. If this is not specified, earliest offset will be used. This offset will only be used for the first run of the pipeline. Any subsequent run will read from the latest offset from previous run.  Offsets are inclusive. If an offset of 5 is used, the message at offset 5 will be read. |
| **Key Field** | **N** | N/A | Optional name of the field containing the message key. A default name of "key" is automatically added to the output schema. If the user wishes the change the default name, the new name must be set and must replace the default name in the output schema. |
| **Partition Field** | **N** | N/A | Optional name of the field containing the partition the message was read from. If this is not set, no partition field will be added to output records. If set, this field must be present in the schema property and must be an int. |
| **Offset Field** | **N** | N/A | Optional name of the field containing the partition offset the message was read from. A default name of "offset" is automatically added to the output schema. If the user wishes the change the default name, the new name must be set and must replace the default name in the output schema. |
| **Format** | **N** | N/A | Optional format of the Kafka event message. Any format supported by CDAP is supported. For example, a value of 'csv' will attempt to parse Kafka payloads as comma-separated values. If no format is given, Kafka message payloads will be treated as bytes. |
